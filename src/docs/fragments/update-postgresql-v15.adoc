This command will make a copy of your existing Postgresql database and update it to version 15.
If there is an issue with the upgraded database, you can fall back to the copy of the previous version.
If the upgrade succeeds,
there will be a `delete_old_cluster.sh` script automatically created
that you can run to safely remove the previous version's data copy.
